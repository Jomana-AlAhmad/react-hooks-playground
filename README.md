## React Hooks Playground - EX3_useState_advanced

Unlike the previous exercies, in this case we start with an unfinished functional component.<br>
The aim of this exercise is to combine the `useState` hook knowledges that we acquired so far and build our own component (almost from scratch ðŸ˜œ).<br>
We have two different states in the component: `count` and `items`.<br>
`count` is a numeric value that starts at 0 and we want to increase and decrease its value 1 second after the relative button is being clicked.<br>
`items` is an array which contains random numbers: we want to add and remove elements from that array so our displayed list can be updated in real time.<br>
If you find yourself stuck or just want to double check your solution, please check out the [EX3_useState_advanced_solution](https://github.com/stefanolepera/react-hooks-playground/tree/EX3_useState_advanced_solution) branch.
