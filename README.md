## React Hooks Playground - The Project

_React Hooks Playground_ is a small project that aims to improve your knowledge of the new Hooks in React.<br>
Every hands on exercise lives in his own branch, so feel free to checkout those branches and solve the related exercise.<br>
Some exercises may ask you to update one or more components written using the traditional React (classes, setState and lifecycle methods) with the new hooks, while some others may ask you to solve a particular problem creating new functional components from scratch with hooks.<br>
Every exercise will have a `_solution` branch that you can check if you feel stuck (or just to double check your solution).<br>
A basic styling is provided using `styled-components`, however styling is out of the scope of the project so feel free to use different form of styling.
