## React Hooks Playground - EX4_useEffect_basic_solution

The `useEffect` hook triggers after every completed render.<br>
Normally you would pass, as second parameter, an array of values that act as a reference for the hook: it will fire only when those values have changed.<br>
In this case we want the hook to fire only once, after the first render, so passing an empty array tells React that your effect doesnâ€™t depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run.<br>

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    // some side effect here
}, []);
```
